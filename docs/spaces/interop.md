vlpds tracks the reference implementation, since the proposal leaves a lot of the wire to it.
Where the spec is silent, vlpds matches the reference's behaviour. Where vlpds differs, it's on
purpose, and `tests/REFERENCE_COVERAGE.md` lists each case.

## The pin

The pin is bluesky-social/atproto PR #5187 (branch `permissioned-data`) at `5b95b2f2`, which has the
Oct 1 changes: HTTP message signatures in place of DPoP, 10-minute credentials with revocation, and
`repoRev`/`spaceRev`. The lexicons are vendored unmodified in `lexicons/spaces-alpha` and the test
vectors in `testdata/spaces-alpha`, both generated from that commit.

Open upstream changes that would move it:

| Upstream | What it changes |
|---|---|
| proposals #114 (STAR) | replaces the 2-root CAR that `getRepo` sends. vlpds's export sits behind a `RepoEncoder` trait so STAR can be a second encoder |
| proposals #119 | moves space management into `com.atproto.space.*` behind a policy token |
| proposals #118 | renames `name` to `title` in space type declarations |

Where the spec is silent and vlpds copies the reference: a removed member stays in `listRepos` at its
last `repoRev`, `listRepoOps` leaves out values for superseded ops, and `listSpaces` treats its
filters as the scope target, so an unfiltered listing needs a wildcard grant.

## Where vlpds differs

| | Reference PDS | vlpds |
|---|---|---|
| Auth | legacy app passwords and password sessions can read and write the account's own space records | OAuth only (final). App passwords (scoped or not) and password sessions get no space reads, writes or delegation tokens, nobody (OAuth included) gets `getServiceAuth` tokens for space methods, and `vlpds.space.importRepo` is OAuth too |
| Fan-out to syncers | each forward goes out as it's sequenced, unordered | one lane per (space, service), in spaceRev order, a writer's waiting forward replaced by its newer one |
| notifyWrite delivery | a retry row written only after a send fails, so an acked write's notify can be lost in a crash | the `sP` row is in the write's own log entry |
| Delegation tokens and client attestations | any lifetime (it mints 60 s) | refused past 300 s, since their `jti`s are held until `exp` |
| Request signatures | no size cap, and header values decoded as latin1 | `Signature-Input` and `Signature` over 8 KiB refused, and header values must be visible ASCII |
| did:keys | refuses hybrid (0x06/0x07) points | the same, checked explicitly, since libsecp256k1 alone would parse them |
| Token claims | `iss` and `sub` need only be truthy | they must be non-empty strings |
| Credential keys | resolves the authority's key on every request | caches a verified credential until `exp`, so a key rotation shows up within the hour |
| Account takedown | the app's session works again after a reversal (what the harness expects) | revokes the account's OAuth sessions, and they stay revoked after a reversal. The app has to sign in again |
| Record takedown | none for space records | hidden from every space read (a vlpds extension, see [Takedowns](privacy.md#takedowns)) |
| Oplog | keeps every op | keeps 7 days. A `since` past that gets the window's start, and the syncer falls back to `getRepo` |
| Revocations | stored for any audience the host has, unbounded, one row each | stored only when the audience account holds a repo in the space or its authority is here (else 200, dropped), capped per authority, space and account, and one past a cap blocks the space's credentials ([Revocation](reading.md#revocation)) |
| Space repo size | no cap | 100k records |
| Backlinks | a like of a space URI is recorded as a backlink | public URIs only |
| `sync.getBlob` with Spaces on | serves only publicly referenced blobs | the same. Without `--spaces`, vlpds still serves an upload before any record names it |
| Space takedown | none | a vlpds extension: no credentials, no `listRepos` or registrations, notifies dropped |
| Credentials for taken-down accounts | issued | refused for a taken-down member or authority |

## Upstream gaps

```steps
- title: HTTP signatures cover two headers
  body: "A request signature covers only `authorization` and `atproto-space-audience`, with no method or URL. So a captured request can be replayed against any read of the same repo while its credential lives. vlpds requires the audience to be a DID and the target repo, checks the credential's space against the request, and checks revocation on every request."
- title: Takedowns and the LtHash (Q11)
  body: "The spec has no record takedown for space data, and a hidden record still counts in the repo's hash. vlpds serves a takedown-adjusted view: every read signs a commit over the set without the hidden records. It keeps every view verifiable, so upstream could adopt it as is."
- title: The getRepo format
  body: "The 2-root CAR has one index block (~6 MB at 100k records) and needs its record blocks in canonical key order, which is why vlpds caps repos at 100k records and exports in two passes. STAR (#114) would remove both problems."
- title: No import endpoint
  body: "Nothing upstream moves a space repo into a new host. vlpds has `vlpds.space.importRepo`, which takes the 2-root CAR that `space.getRepo` serves and checks it against the DID's current key, and it'll follow the upstream contract once there is one."
