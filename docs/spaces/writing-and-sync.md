A space write is durable before its 200, the same as a public commit. What's different is what
happens next. Nothing goes on the firehose. The author's PDS tells the space's authority with
`notifyWrite`, the authority puts the writer into a space-wide order, and syncers pull the new ops
from the author's PDS.

## One write, one entry

```diagram
caption: "The repo worker turns a space write into one private log entry. Its rows all land in the same segment, so they're durable together. When the author is also the authority, the writer rows go in the same entry and no notify is sent."
nodes:
  - { id: app, label: createRecord, sub: "or put · delete · applyWrites", at: [0, 3], size: [9, 3], tone: ink }
  - { id: wk, label: Repo worker, sub: the author's, at: [12, 3], size: [8, 3], tone: accent }

  - { id: sw, label: "`sW` `sQ`", sub: self-authority only, at: [23, 8], size: [9, 2.2], shape: note, tone: violet }
groups:
  - { label: one segment PUT, around: [sr, so, sh, sp], tone: amber }
edges:
  - "app -> wk"
  - "wk -> e: one rev"
  - e.r -> sr.l
  - e.r -> so.l

  - { from: e.b, to: sw.t, dash: true }
```

- The worker serializes space writes with the account's status changes, so a write can't slip past a
  takedown or a deactivation.
- Ops in one `applyWrites` share a rev and land as one batch (200 ops at most). A write that would
  grow a space repo past `--space-repo-max-records` (100k) gets `InvalidRequest`.
- The 200 goes out once the segment is in the bucket, applied, and the lease re-checked. That's the
  same path as a public commit ([The path of a commit](../the-path-of-a-commit.md)).
- Concurrent space writes to one repo don't share segments yet. At a concurrency of 4, space writes
  cost 1.0 segment PUT each where public writes cost 0.68, because public commits pipeline into
  shared segments and space writes don't. The fix isn't built yet.

## The outbox

```timeline

  - { id: w, label: Author's writes, tone: accent }

  - { lane: h, from: 1.2, to: 5.6, label: sequence rev 1, tone: violet }

events:
  - { lane: w, at: 0.5, label: rev 1 }
  - { lane: w, at: 2.8, label: rev 2 }
  - { lane: w, at: 4.6, label: rev 3 }
arrows:
  - { from: ob, to: h, at: 1.0, label: notifyWrite }
  - { from: h, to: ob, at: 5.8, side: left, label: "200" }

  - { from: h, to: ob, at: 10.2, side: left, label: "200" }
```

The `sP` row is written in the write's own entry, so a notify for every acked write survives a crash
or a takeover. The sending side lives in memory on the shard's owner.

| | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| When it sends | as soon as nothing is in flight for that (repo, space), with no linger |
| Where it sends | a local authority is told on its own worker with no HTTP. One on another cluster node gets `/internal/v1/space/notify`. Anything else gets `notifyWrite` at its `#atproto_space_host` (or `#atproto_pds`) with the writer's service auth, a 10 s timeout and the SSRF-guarded client |
| Retries | from 1 min, doubling to 1 h with 50–100% jitter, until 24 h after the rev was written. A permanent refusal drops the row |
| Inactive writers | a taken-down or deactivated account's rows wait and resume on reactivation |
| Cleanup | a delivered row's `sP` delete rides the author's next space write, so delivery costs no PUT |
| Bounds | 262,144 rows held in memory (the rest are rescanned once it drains to half) and 256 sends in flight |

## At the authority

```steps
- title: Check the rev
  body: "`repoRev` more than 5 min in the future gets `FutureRev`. The writer must pass the space's `writePolicy` (a managing app is asked with `checkUserAccess`)."
- title: Sequence it on the authority's worker
  body: "A `repoRev` at or below the writer's last one is a no-op, so a resent notify is harmless. Otherwise the worker assigns the next `spaceRev` (a TID) and writes `sW` plus the `sQ` swap as one private entry. One worker per authority means no lock."
- title: Answer 200 once it's durable
  body: "The writer's outbox only drops its row after this."
- title: Fan out
  body: "Sequenced writes leave the worker in ack order for the fan-out, off the request path."
```

## Fan-out

```diagram
caption: "Each (space, service) gets its own lane, which sends one forward at a time in spaceRev order. A slow syncer holds up only its own lane. Bounds are per lane (256), per service host (4,096 queued, 16 sends in flight) and for the dispatcher (4,096)."

  - { id: hw, label: Authority's worker, sub: acks in spaceRev order, at: [0, 4], size: [9, 3], tone: violet }
  - { id: d, label: Dispatcher, sub: reads `sN` registrations, at: [12.5, 4], size: [9, 3], tone: violet }

  - { id: s3, label: Syncer C, sub: slow, at: [39, 8.4], size: [8, 2.6], tone: muted }
edges:
  - "hw -> d: sequenced"
  - d.r -> l1.l
  - d.r -> l2.l
  - d.r -> l3.l
  - "l1 -> s1: notifyWrite"
  - l2 -> s2
  - { from: l3, to: s3, label: retry · backoff, dash: true }
```

- A forward waiting in a lane is replaced by a newer one from the same writer, since only a writer's
  newest state is worth sending.
- The `prevSpaceRev` a lane sends is the last spaceRev it delivered, so a replaced forward leaves no
  gap. A forward lost for good (a full queue, retries run out) does leave one, and the syncer catches
  up with `listRepos`.
- A failed forward is retried with jittered backoff from 1 s, but only while nothing newer from its
  writer waits.
- Registrations (`registerNotify`) last 24 h. Expired ones are pruned.

The reference sends each forward as it's sequenced, with no order. Its syncers see about 3–5
`prevSpaceRev` gaps per ~80 forwards, and each one costs a `listRepos` call.

## How a syncer pulls

| Call | Served from | Measured on vlpds | Reference |
|---|---|---|---|
| `listRepoOps`, `since` = head | the in-memory head, no state read | 0.28 ms p50 · 0.54 ms p99 · 0.12 ms server · 0 bucket ops | 6.7 ms p50 |
| `listRepoOps`, a delta | a range scan of `sO` from `since`, values joined from `sR` | 0.41 ms p50 · 1.9 ms p99 · 0.17 ms server | 8.3 ms |
| `getRepo` | two streamed passes over one snapshot, under an export slot | bounded by the 100k record cap | |
| `listRepos` (at the authority) | a cursor scan of `sQ` joined to `sW` | | |

When a page of `listRepoOps` reaches the head it includes the commit, signed for this response. The
syncer checks its running LtHash against the commit's hash. If they differ it falls back to
`getRepo`. That's also what happens when `since` is older than the 7-day oplog window, since vlpds
answers from the window's start and the replayed hash can't match. Numbers are client-side from the
interop harness at `8f837fa8` (one node, MinIO).

| # | Crash | The app saw | What recovery does |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | before the segment is durable | no 200 | Nothing to replay. The app retries. |
| 2 | durable, before the 200 | no 200 | The next owner replays the entry, `sP` row included, so the notify still goes out. A blind retry is a second write. |
| 3 | after the 200, before the authority's 200 | the 200 | The `sP` row is in the bucket. Whichever node opens the shard next rescans `sP` and sends the newest rev. |
| 4 | at the authority, after its entry is durable | the 200 | The authority keeps the spaceRev. The fan-out was only in memory, so a syncer sees a `prevSpaceRev` gap and catches up with `listRepos`. |
| 5 | delivered, before the `sP` delete lands | the 200 | The row is resent once. The authority ignores a `repoRev` it has already seen. |

The reference stores a notify for retry only after a send fails, so an acked write's notify can be
lost if the process dies first. vlpds doesn't have that window, since the row is in the same entry as
the write. In a kill -9
test on three nodes (about 33k acked writes), nothing acked was lost and spaceRevs only moved
forward.
