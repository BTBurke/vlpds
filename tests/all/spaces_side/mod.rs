//! Spaces phase 1 side lane: leak, durability and fuzz harnesses and the
//! sync micro-bench, which drive the space surface over XRPC (see
//! tests/all/common/spaces.rs), and the ported reference space suites
//! (`ref_*`, on the `ref_net` harness). Phase 2's cluster checks are the
//! `cluster_*` modules: split and merge with space rows, revocation across
//! nodes, the leak test across nodes and their peer streams, and takeover
//! mid-burst. Phase 3's: importRepo round trips and refusals
//! (`import_repo`), space repos in the account backup (`backup`), takedowns
//! on every read path (`takedowns`) and audited operator reads
//! (`operator_reads`), with their shared pieces in `phase3`.
