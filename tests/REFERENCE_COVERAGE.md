# Reference PDS test coverage

Every `it()` case in the reference TypeScript PDS's own suite (`bluesky-social/atproto` main,
`packages/pds/tests/**/*.test.ts`, 51 files) mapped to the vlpds test that covers it, or to why it doesn't apply, or to the
gap. Audited 2026-10-02. Each "covered" row was checked against what the vlpds test actually asserts, not just its name.

Status values:

- **covered**: an existing vlpds test asserts the same externally observable behavior.
- **ported**: a new test in `tests/all/ref_*.rs` (or `oauth::ref_oauth`) ports the case.
- **N/A**: the case tests something vlpds doesn't have or can't observe over the wire, such as SQLite/Kysely internals, TS unit
  internals, browser (puppeteer) UI, entryway mode, Ozone/AppView behavior behind the proxy, or `it.skip` cases.
- **divergent**: vlpds deliberately behaves differently (reason given; the notable ones are also in DESIGN.md).
- **GAP**: not covered and not fixed here (reason given).

## Summary

| | Cases |
|---|---:|
| covered | 295 |
| ported | 79 |
| N/A | 64 |
| divergent | 7 |
| GAP (left) | 0 |
| **total** | **445** |

Some rows marked `ported` or `covered` also carry a partial divergence that the row explains, for example "ported + divergent".

New test modules (`cargo test --test all ref_`): `ref_account`, `ref_auth`, `ref_handles`, `ref_invites`,
`ref_moderation`, `ref_moderator_auth`, `ref_plc`, `ref_proxy`, `ref_repo`, `ref_ssrf`, `ref_sync`, plus `oauth::ref_oauth`.

## Product fixes made by this pass

1. **Read-after-write Accept-Encoding negotiation** (`src/xrpc/proxy/read_after_write.rs`). A malformed `Accept-Encoding` is now
   400 `Invalid accept-encoding: "<part>"`, and one that rules out identity and every decodable coding is 406 NotAcceptable.
   Before, vlpds forwarded the header unchecked. Also, `*;q=0` next to an explicit coding no longer expands into a contradictory
   `gzip, gzip;q=0`.
2. **OAuth scope refusals** (`src/xrpc/authn.rs` `need_*`, used across repo/proxy/blobs/identity/server). A missing scope is now
   403 `ScopeMissingError` `Missing required scope "<scope>"`, as the reference does. It was 403 `InsufficientScope` with a generic
   message. A non-privileged app password calling a chat method through the proxy is now 400 InvalidToken "Bad token method".
3. **Deactivation over OAuth drops delegated credentials** (`src/xrpc/server.rs` `delete_delegated_credentials`). This is the
   reference's `deleteCredentials`: it drops all OAuth sessions, the remembered client authorizations, and every app password with
   its sessions. Password sessions stay.
4. **refreshSession with an access token** now fails with "Token could not be verified", the reference's jose `typ` check, instead
   of "Bad token scope".
5. **Writing into another account's repo** (create/put/delete/applyWrites) is now 401 AuthenticationRequired "Authentication
   Required". It was 403 Forbidden. A missing Authorization header says "Authentication Required".
6. **listRecords of an unknown, taken-down or deactivated repo** is now 400 InvalidRequest `Could not find repo: <repo>`, the
   reference's message. The owner and admins still read their own repos.
7. **describeServer** returns `blobUploadLimit`, `links.privacyPolicy`, `links.termsOfService` and `contact.email`. These come from
   the new `--privacy-policy-url`, `--terms-of-service-url` and `--contact-email-address` flags, which fall back to the reference's
   `PDS_*` variables.
8. **createAccount "Email already taken"** echoes the address as the user typed it.
9. **Moderation-service auth on admin methods** (`--mod-service-did`, `src/xrpc/authn.rs` `MODERATOR_METHODS`): Ozone calls
   the reference's `authVerifier.moderator` methods, and reads any account's getPreferences, with a service JWT; the
   admin-token-only methods still take Basic auth only. Errors are the reference's (`UntrustedIss` "Untrusted issuer", ...).
10. **Earned invite codes** (`--invite-interval-ms`, `--invite-epoch-ms`): getAccountInviteCodes creates codes with the
    reference's `calculateCodesToCreate`.
11. **Disposable email blocklist** (`src/email_policy.rs`, the reference's `disposable-email-domains-js` list) on createAccount
    and updateEmail.
12. **DNS TXT handle proof** (`src/handle_resolver.rs`): `_atproto.<handle>` TXT alongside `/.well-known/atproto-did`, in the
    reference HandleResolver's order and timeouts.
13. **Signing-key rotation re-signs the repo** (`src/xrpc/key_rotation.rs`, worker `KeyStep`). `admin.updateAccountSigningKey`
    (and `publishIdentity` with `syncPlc`, the rotate-keys script) writes an empty commit signed with the new key and emits
    `#identity` then `#sync`, so `getRepo` and the firehose verify against the new DID document right away. The new key is
    recorded before PLC is updated, writes wait out the rotation, and a rotation interrupted by an outage or a crash is finished
    from durable state by a retried call or the first write it fences (DESIGN.md "Signing-key rotation").
14. **Duplicate likes/reposts/follows/blocks are pruned** (`src/backlinks.rs`, a `bl/` backlink index). createRecord (unless
    `validate: false`) deletes the account's earlier record of the collection with the same subject (`subject.uri` for likes and
    reposts, the `subject` DID for follows and blocks) in the new record's commit, as the reference's `getBacklinkConflicts`
    (DESIGN.md "Backlinks").
15. **User service auth on uploadBlob** (`src/xrpc/authn.rs` `USER_SERVICE_AUTH_METHODS`, `Credentials::UserServiceAuth`). The
    reference authorizes `com.atproto.repo.uploadBlob` with `authorizationOrUserServiceAuth`: a Bearer token carrying an `lxm`
    claim is verified as a service JWT issued by the user (iss = a DID hosted here, aud = the PDS's service DID exactly,
    lxm = uploadBlob, signed with the current `#atproto` key) and the blob is that user's. The Bluesky app's video upload depends
    on it: the app gets such a token from getServiceAuth and gives it to video.bsky.app, which uploads the processed video to the
    PDS. vlpds refused it (InvalidToken), so video posts failed. **This audit missed it because no reference test exercises
    uploadBlob with service auth** (file-uploads.test.ts and the rest only upload with sessions); it was found by reading
    `auth-verifier.ts`. Tests: `user_service_auth::*` (getServiceAuth → uploadBlob → post with `app.bsky.embed.video`, listBlobs,
    getBlob; a stub video service end to end; wrong lxm / aud / expired / another user's key / a rotated-out key / a foreign or
    `did#service` issuer refused with the reference's errors; refused on every other method) and
    `ha_auth::user_service_auth_uploads_route_to_the_owner` (cluster routing by `iss`). Account status: taken-down accounts are
    refused also with service auth (divergence below). createAccount's `userServiceAuthOptional` (migration in) was already
    verified the same way (`authn::optional_service_auth`).
16. **Identity fixes** (`src/plc`, `src/xrpc/identity.rs`, claims in `src/xrpc/server.rs`; DESIGN.md "PLC identity"). Not
    reached by the reference suite, which runs against its in-process PLC server through `@did-plc/lib`'s client (it ignores
    POST bodies) and never resolves another server's handle:
    - every PLC write against a real did-method-plc directory was applied and then reported as failed (its `POST /:did`
      answers a text/plain `OK`, parsed as JSON). The mock directory now answers the same;
    - resolveHandle / resolveIdentity resolve handles and DIDs hosted elsewhere (AppView's resolveHandle, else the handle
      resolver), as the reference's resolveHandle does, so @-mentions of other servers' users resolve through the PDS;
    - createAccount with an existing DID refuses a `did#service` issuer (the reference compares the whole `iss`);
    - concurrent signups with one email can no longer both win; stale handle/email claims are taken over after a grace period;
    - concurrent PLC updates of one DID are serialized and rebuilt on `prev` races; updateHandle reconciles directory and
      account; submitPlcOperation is refused during a pending signing-key rotation; signPlcOperation consumes its token last
      (reference order); a DID with a signed op handed out or a user rotation key resolves through the directory.
    Tests: `plc::mock::tests::*`, `identity_races::*`.

## Notable divergences

- **Account deletion and firehose replay.** The reference deletes a deleted DID's earlier `repo_seq` rows, so a replay contains only
  the `#account` tombstone. vlpds's firehose is its append-only log, so a replay from before the deletion still carries that DID's
  earlier frames until retention drops the segments. Both guarantee that `#account deleted` is the DID's last event
  (`ref_sync::account_deletion_is_the_last_event_on_replay`). See DESIGN.md "Reference test divergences".
- **listRepos order** is `(slot, DID)` (per shard), not creation order.
- **getRepo `since`** returns a superset: the commit, all MST nodes and the newer records.
- **Uploaded blobs before a record references them** are served by getBlob in vlpds. The reference keeps them in a temp store and
  refuses.
- **Proxy target defaults.** vlpds needs an explicit `atproto-proxy` for `chat.bsky.*` and answers 501 for namespaces other than
  `app.bsky`/`tools.ozone`. The reference sends everything without a header to the AppView, and the listed `tools.ozone.*` methods
  to its `modService`. vlpds sends `tools.ozone.*` to the AppView: `--mod-service-did` is used for inbound auth only (no
  `modServiceUrl` routing).
- **Unresolvable proxy DIDs** (`did:foo#bar`) are 400 "could not resolve proxy did". The reference's resolver throws, which surfaces
  as a 500.
- **Stricter session requirements.** `revokeAppPassword`, `identity.updateHandle` and `identity.submitPlcOperation` need a full
  session (or OAuth with the identity scope); the reference accepts an app-password session (`ACCESS_STANDARD`; its
  `assertIdentity` applies to OAuth only). Deliberate: an app password can't move the account's identity.
- **resolveHandle of an unresolvable external handle** is 400 `HandleNotFound` (the lexicon's error); the reference throws a plain
  `InvalidRequest` "Unable to resolve handle". A dev-mode vlpds resolves external handles only through the AppView.
- **disable/enableAccountInvites** act on the account's existing codes as well as the flag. The reference only flips the flag,
  which marks interval-generated codes disabled when they are created (vlpds does that too).
- **OAuth UI** has no forgot-password step and no deactivate button. Those are the XRPC flows, and the pages are English only.
- **Legacy blob refs** are refused everywhere. The reference upgrades them on profile updates as a temporary hack.
- **uploadBlob with user service auth on a taken-down account** is 401 AccountTakedown, as with a session. The reference's
  `userServiceAuth` skips the account status check (its `checkTakedown` applies to the session path only), so a token issued
  before a takedown would still upload for up to an hour. Deactivated accounts upload either way.

### recovery.test.ts

| case | status | vlpds |
|---|---|---|

Product fix: it used to emit `#identity` only and sign just the next commit with the new key. `tests/all/key_rotation.rs` adds writers racing the rotation, PLC refusal/outage, a deactivated account, and the owner crashing after recording the key and after the PLC update (finished by an admin retry or by the first fenced write); `go_checker::go_checker_accepts_key_rotation_resync` runs the Go checker over it |

| takendown actor is not allowed to create records. | covered | `moderation::takendown_actor_cannot_report_or_write`; exact 400 InvalidToken "Bad token scope" in `ref_account::ref_takendown_session_appeal_is_forwarded` |

The call carries an explicit `atproto-proxy` header: vlpds refuses chat.bsky.* without one (`proxy::target_selection_and_rejections`), where the reference defaults it to the AppView.

User service auth on uploadBlob (`authorizationOrUserServiceAuth`) has no reference test; see "Product fixes" 15 and

### oauth.test.ts

(The reference drives its React sign-in UI with puppeteer in French; vlpds has its own server-rendered English pages, driven with form posts in tests/all/oauth.rs.)

| case | status | vlpds |
|---|---|---|
| Allows to sign-up through OAuth (prompt=create) | covered | `oauth::prompt_create_signs_up`, `oauth::sign_up_page_with_required_invites` |
| Allows canceling the OAuth flow | covered | `oauth::account_chooser_prompts_and_denial` (deny -> `access_denied` redirect with state + iss), `oauth::response_modes_form_post_and_fragment` |
| allows resetting the password | divergent | vlpds's OAuth pages have no "forgot password" step. Password reset is the XRPC requestPasswordReset/resetPassword flow (`smtp_mail::password_reset_is_mailed_over_smtp`, `email_flows`) used by the account web UI. Locale negotiation (`locale: 'fr'`) is N/A: the pages are English only |
| restores the reset-password step after a page refresh | divergent | as above (no reset step in the OAuth UI) |
| Allows to sign-in through OAuth | covered | `oauth::full_flow_create_record_refresh_and_revoke` ("remember this account" = the device cookie) |
| remembers the session | covered | `oauth::account_chooser_prompts_and_denial` (remembered device accounts skip the password) |
| revokes OAuth sessions on deactivation & requires re-activation on sign-in | ported (partly divergent) | Revocation: `oauth::ref_oauth::ref_account_deactivation_over_oauth` (product fix: OAuth deactivation now drops OAuth sessions, authorized clients and app passwords). Divergent: vlpds's account page has no "deactivate" button (deactivation is the XRPC method), and signing in to a deactivated account is refused ("This account is deactivated or suspended", `LoginError::Inactive`) instead of offering "Yes, reactivate my account" |
| with 2FA > Allows to sign-in through OAuth | covered | `oauth::email_code_prompt_on_login` (code mailed on the password step, masked address hint, code step). `locale: 'fr'` reaching the mailer is N/A (English only) |
| with 2FA > Prevents to sign-in through OAuth with invalid OTP | covered | `oauth::email_code_prompt_on_login` ("AAAAA-AAAAA" -> "Invalid sign-in code", then the right code) |

### oauth-deactivation.test.ts

| case | status | vlpds |
|---|---|---|
| rejects deactivation when the session lacks the status scope | ported | `oauth::ref_oauth::ref_account_deactivation_over_oauth`. Product fix: OAuth scope refusals were 403 `InsufficientScope` "credentials do not grant this action"; they are now the reference's 403 `ScopeMissingError` `Missing required scope "<scope>"` (src/xrpc/authn.rs `need_*`) |
| rejects reactivation over OAuth with a message pointing at the account page | ported | same test (already implemented; message mentions the "account management page") |
| deactivates the account when the status scope is granted | ported | same test (getRepoStatus `{did, active: false, status: "deactivated"}`) |
| revokes app passwords on OAuth deactivation | ported | same test. Product fix: OAuth deactivation now deletes the app passwords (and their sessions) |
| revokes the OAuth session that performed the deactivation | ported | same test (getSession 401 for that and every other OAuth session; the password session is kept, as in the reference). Product fix: OAuth deactivation now revokes all OAuth sessions and remembered authorizations. Control: `oauth::ref_oauth::ref_password_session_deactivation_keeps_credentials` |

### oauth-lexicon.test.ts

| case | status | vlpds |
|---|---|---|
| resolves permission sets hosted on the PDS itself | covered | `oauth::include_permission_set` (permission set published in a local repo, resolved, shown on consent, granted scope narrowed to it) |
| fails to resolve lexicons that do not exist on the PDS | covered | `oauth::include_permission_set` (unresolvable `include:` -> `invalid_scope` at PAR). The reference calls the lexicon manager directly; its error text is TS-internal |

### ssrf.test.ts

| case | status | vlpds |
|---|---|---|
| with ssrf protection enabled > refuses to send registerPush to a non-unicast endpoint. | ported | `ref_ssrf::ref_with_ssrf_protection_enabled_nothing_is_sent` (vlpds's SSRF policy is on outside dev mode; service DID is a did:plc in the mock directory, endpoint `http://localhost:<port>`) |
| with ssrf protection enabled > refuses to send unregisterPush to a non-unicast endpoint. | ported | same test |

| CRUDs records with the semantic sugars | covered | `crud::creates_gets_lists_and_deletes_records` (the sugars are client-side wrappers over the same routes) |
| attaches images to a post | ported + divergent | `ref_repo::ref_attaches_images_to_a_post` (unlisted until referenced, then listed and served; record carries the same ref). Divergent: the reference refuses `getBlob` before a record references the upload (temp store); vlpds writes uploads straight to their final key and serves them to anyone holding the CID until the GC sweep collects them |

| putRecord > fails on invalid record | ported | `ref_repo::ref_put_record_invalid_update_leaves_record` (the float case's message is "floats are not allowed" without the `$.record.description` path; the integer case names the field) |
| putRecord > updates a legacy blob ref when updating profile | divergent | vlpds refuses legacy `{cid, mimeType}` blob refs on every write (`crud::rejects_legacy_blob_refs_and_bad_values`). The reference's profile-only upgrade is a `@TODO remove after migrating legacy blobs` hack; vlpds is a new PDS with no legacy-blob data to migrate |

| prevents duplicate likes | ported | `ref_repo::ref_prevents_duplicate_backlinks` (**fix**: vlpds had no backlink index. createRecord now deletes the account's earlier like with the same `subject.uri` in the new record's commit, as the reference's `getBacklinkConflicts`, unless `validate: false`; applyWrites and imports don't prune. Index `bl/` in src/backlinks.rs, DESIGN.md "Backlinks"; more cases in `backlinks::*`: the firehose commit carries the deletes, applyWrites/import duplicates, concurrent creates, replay after kill -9, reshard) |

| handles client abort | ported | `ref_repo::ref_upload_client_abort` (body stream fails mid-upload; server stays healthy, nothing stored) |
| uploads files | covered | `file_uploads::uploads_references_and_serves_a_blob` (the reference's temp-key table rows are SQLite internals; the observable part is the returned ref/size/mime) |

Note: vlpds deletes blob bytes in a GC sweep with a grace period (`blob_deletes::gc_grace_protects_recent_uploads`), not in the write transaction; the tests run a zero-grace sweep.

### preferences.test.ts

| case | status | vlpds |
|---|---|---|
| requires auth to set or put preferences. | covered | `ref_repo::ref_preferences_error_messages` (**fix**: missing-auth message "authentication required" -> the reference's "Authentication Required". Note: the reference's error *name* for a missing Authorization header is `AuthMissing` (auth-verifier.ts `AuthRequiredError(undefined, 'AuthMissing')`); vlpds and its suite use `AuthenticationRequired`, left as is) |
| gets preferences, before any are set. | covered | `preferences::put_get_update_and_clear` |
| only gets preferences in app.bsky namespace. | N/A | seeds a `com.atproto` pref through the TS actor store directly; over XRPC vlpds (like the reference) refuses non-app.bsky prefs, so there is no external way to plant one (`ref_repo::ref_preferences_error_messages`) |

### races.test.ts

| case | status | vlpds |
|---|---|---|
| handles races in record routes | covered | `races::concurrent_record_writes_all_land` (the reference stalls a transaction through actor-store internals; vlpds drives concurrent writes over XRPC and verifies the exported repo), plus `races::concurrent_swap_*` |

### sync/list.test.ts

| case | status | vlpds |
|---|---|---|
| lists hosted repos in order of creation | divergent | `sync_list::lists_all_hosted_repos` checks completeness, head and rev. The order is `(slot, DID)`, not creation order: the listing is served per shard (DESIGN.md "Online shard split/merge", listRepos) |
| paginates listed hosted repos | covered | `sync_list::paginates_listed_repos` |

### sync/subscribe-repos.test.ts

| case | status | vlpds |

| syncs account events | covered | `subscribe_repos::account_events_deactivate_and_takedown` |
| syncs interleaved account events | covered | `subscribe_repos::interleaved_account_events`. Divergent detail: vlpds revokes sessions on takedown, so the test logs in again before activating |
| emits sync event on account activation | covered | `subscribe_repos::sync_event_on_account_activation` |
| syncs account deletions (account evt) | covered | `subscribe_repos::account_deletion_events` |
| account deletions invalidate all seq ops | divergent + ported | `ref_sync::account_deletion_is_the_last_event_on_replay`. The reference deletes the DID's earlier `repo_seq` rows. The vlpds log is the firehose and is immutable, so earlier events stay in a replay. The test checks the shared guarantee: `#account deleted` is the DID's last event, it appears exactly once, and the repo is gone |
| sends info frame on out of date cursor | covered | `subscribe_repos::outdated_cursor_info_or_full_replay`. vlpds serves old cursors from the durable log when it can (full replay), and otherwise sends `#info OutdatedCursor` first |
| errors on future cursor | covered | `subscribe_repos::errors_on_future_cursor` |

### plc-rotation-key-override.test.ts

| case | status | vlpds |
|---|---|---|
| uses the override for XRPC account creation | N/A | It tests the TS constructor-injection override (`plcRotationKey` over the hex config). vlpds takes one configured `RotationKey`, and `plc::create_account_registers_the_genesis_op` checks that the genesis op carries it |
| uses the override for handle updates | N/A | Same TS-internal override (it calls `accountManager.updateHandle` directly). The behavior is covered by `plc::update_handle_submits_a_plc_update_first` |
| uses the override for OAuth account creation | N/A | Same TS-internal override (`oauthProvider.accountManager.createAccount`). OAuth sign-up (`oauth::prompt_create_signs_up`) goes through the same `create_account_inner` as XRPC createAccount, so it registers with the same key |

### moderation.test.ts

### invites-admin.test.ts

These are adapted: alice's own codes are admin-gifted rather than interval-earned (the interval cases are in invite-codes above).

| case | status | vlpds |
|---|---|---|
| gets a list of invite codes by recency | ported | `ref_invites::lists_invite_codes_by_recency_and_paginates` |

| creates codes in the background but disables them | ported | `invite_codes::ref_creates_disabled_codes_for_a_disabled_account` (interval 1 ms; the 5 codes read through admin.getInviteCodes instead of SQL) |
| re-enables an accounts invites | ported + divergent | `ref_invites::disables_and_reenables_account_invites`. vlpds re-enables the account's existing codes. The reference only clears the flag and then generates fresh codes, so codes an admin disabled by account through disableInviteCodes would stay disabled there but be re-enabled by vlpds |

## Proxying (tests/proxied)

### proxied/admin.test.ts

These drive a real Ozone through the PDS proxy (`tools.ozone.*` → mod service). What they assert is Ozone's behavior (report/event/repo views, label state). The PDS's part — forwarding `tools.ozone.*` with service auth and relaying upstream errors — is generic proxying.

| case | status | vlpds |
|---|---|---|
| creates reports of a repo. | covered | `proxy::create_report_goes_to_report_service` (createReport → configured report service, service-auth `lxm`/`aud`, body relayed) |
| takes actions and resolves reports | N/A | Ozone moderation-event semantics; the PDS only forwards (`proxy::proxies_to_default_appview_with_service_auth_and_header_rules`) |
| fetches moderation events. | N/A | Ozone view |
| fetches repo details. | N/A | Ozone view |
| fetches record details. | N/A | Ozone view |
| fetches event details. | N/A | Ozone view |
| fetches a list of events. | N/A | Ozone view |
| searches repos. | N/A | Ozone view |
| passes through errors. | covered | `proxy::maps_upstream_errors` (4xx name/message relayed, 500 → 502), `ref_proxy::ref_proxy_catchall_ok_and_error` |
| takesdown and labels repos, and reverts. | covered | the PDS side (admin `updateSubjectStatus` takedown/restore of a repo, which Ozone calls): `moderation::takes_down_and_restores_accounts`; labels are Ozone's |
| takesdown and labels records, and reverts. | covered | `moderation::takes_down_and_restores_records`; labels are Ozone's |

### proxied/decompression-bound.test.ts

| case | status | vlpds |
|---|---|---|
| stops parsing an oversized decoded error body. | ported | `ref_proxy::ref_proxy_oversized_error_body_is_not_parsed` (gzip bomb and an uncompressed >10 MiB body; the status is relayed, the error name is not). vlpds never decodes a compressed error body (the reference decodes up to the cap), so the bomb is never inflated |
| rejects an oversized decoded read-after-write body. | ported | `ref_proxy::ref_proxy_oversized_read_after_write_body` (502 `upstream response too large`) |
| rejects an oversized body that is not compressed. | ported | `ref_proxy::ref_proxy_oversized_read_after_write_body` (wire cap, 502). vlpds's cap is the reference default (10 MiB, not configurable) |

### proxied/feedgen.test.ts

| case | status | vlpds |
|---|---|---|
| performs basic proxy of getFeed | covered | `read_after_write::get_feed_service_auth_names_the_generator` (generator record lookup, token `aud` = feed generator DID, `lxm` = getFeedSkeleton, UnknownFeed) |

### proxied/notif.test.ts

| proxies unregisterPush to notif service. | covered | same tests (both methods) |

### proxied/procedures.test.ts

The muting state lives in the AppView; the PDS part is proxying a JSON procedure with service auth.

| case | status | vlpds |
|---|---|---|
| maintains muted actors. | covered | generic POST proxy: `proxy::streams_post_bodies` (body, content-type, method relayed); mute state is AppView behavior (N/A) |
| maintains muted actor lists. | covered | as above |
| maintains notification last seen state. | covered | as above |

### proxied/proxy-catchall.test.ts

| case | status | vlpds |
|---|---|---|

| handles cancelled downstream requests | ported | `ref_proxy::ref_proxy_cancelled_downstream` |

### proxied/proxy-header.test.ts

| case | status | vlpds |
|---|---|---|
| parses proxy header | ported | `ref_proxy::ref_proxy_header_errors` (every message over the wire). divergent (minor): `did:foo#bar`, `did:foo:bar#baz`, `foo#bar` — the reference's resolver throws PoorlyFormattedDid/UnsupportedDidMethod, which surfaces as a 500; vlpds answers 400 "could not resolve proxy did" |
| proxies requests based on header | covered | `proxy::target_selection_and_rejections` (did:web target, path, service JWT verified: `iss`, bare-DID `aud`, `lxm`) |
| fails on a non-existant did | ported | `ref_proxy::ref_proxy_header_errors`; `proxy::target_selection_and_rejections` |
| fails when a service is not specified | ported | `ref_proxy::ref_proxy_header_errors` |
| fails on a non-existant service | ported | `ref_proxy::ref_proxy_header_errors`; `proxy::target_selection_and_rejections` |
| handles failing manual pipethroughs | ported | `ref_proxy::ref_proxy_header_errors` (getPreferences for another service → upstream 501 relayed) |

### proxied/proxy-oauth-aud.test.ts

The reference stubs the auth verifier and calls `proxyHandler` directly; it checks that the scope check sees `did#serviceId`.

| case | status | vlpds |
|---|---|---|
| matches an OAuth rpc scope granted with combined did#serviceId aud | covered | `oauth::scopes::tests::rpc` (lib unit test) + the proxy checks `creds.allows_rpc(lxm, Target::scope_aud())` = `did#service_id` (src/xrpc/proxy.rs) |

### proxied/views.test.ts

All 20 cases snapshot AppView views fetched through the PDS (`app.bsky.*` GETs). Their content is the AppView's; the PDS behavior (default AppView target, service auth, header allow-lists, error relay) is covered by `proxy::proxies_to_default_appview_with_service_auth_and_header_rules`, `proxy::maps_upstream_errors` and the read-after-write tests.
